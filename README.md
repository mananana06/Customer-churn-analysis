# Customer-churn-analysis

## Unveiling the Project
In today’s competitive world, understanding why customers leave a company is crucial for success. One big challenge is customer churn—the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. To tackle this, I took on an exciting project using Power BI to create a dashboard for analyzing customer churn. This dashboard helps companies predict and address customer loss by using powerful analytics and clear visualizations. The goal is to spot high-risk customers and offer practical solutions to keep them around.

## Data Overview
For this project, I worked with a synthetic dataset from a fictional telecom company named Databel. The dataset includes a variety of information such as customer demographics (like age and gender), contract details, payment methods, and subscription data (such as monthly and total charges, data plans, and calling plans). It also shows whether customers have churned and, if so, why. This dataset provides a great base for understanding customer behavior and churn patterns.

## Transforming the Data
The first step in using Power BI is transforming the data with Power Query. This means you can clean up and adjust the dataset by removing unnecessary rows or changing values. With so many columns in this dataset, it was important to focus on the most important ones. For this project, I focused on key details like customer age, gender, state of residence, contract specifics (such as length, charges, and type), and customer retention data that shows whether customers have churned and their reasons for doing so.

## Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard I created gives a detailed look at customer churn. It visually shows how different factors contribute to customers leaving and highlights where improvements can be made.

## Key Insights
#### Churn Breakdown by Reason 
Out of 6,687 customers, nearly 27% have churned. The majority of them (45%) left for a competitor, while 17% left due to poor customer service, 16% due to dissatisfaction, 11% because of pricing, and 10% for other reasons.
####Age-Based Churn Trends 
The churn rate increases with customer age, showing a significant rise among those aged 50 to 60.
Geographic Churn Insights: The top five states with the highest customer loss are Ohio, West Virginia, Oregon, Alabama, and Maryland.
#### Monthly vs. Yearly Plans 
About half of the customers are on monthly plans, which have a higher churn rate compared to yearly plans. This suggests that the flexibility of monthly plans might be causing more customers to leave.
#### Impact of Monthly Charges on Churn 
Higher monthly charges are linked to higher churn rates, particularly for those on month-to-month plans.

## Strategic Recommendations
Based on these insights, here are some suggestions to reduce churn:
#### Address Churn Reasons 
Offer better pricing, improve customer service, act on customer feedback, introduce different pricing plans, and create specific retention campaigns.
#### Develop age-specific Offers 
Create special deals for customers aged 50 and up, like senior discounts and easier support.
#### Localize Marketing Strategies 
Focus on the top states with high churn by offering regional deals and enhancing service quality.
#### Incentivize Annual Plans
Encourage customers to switch from monthly to annual plans with discounts and flexible options.
#### Reassess Pricing Strategies 
Offer flexible payment options and promotions, and develop pricing that provides more value for higher plans.

## Final Thoughts
In this project, I used Power BI to build a customer churn analysis dashboard that gives valuable insights into customer behavior. By focusing on key metrics—like age, gender, contract details, and churn reasons—I provided a clear view of what affects churn. These insights can help companies understand why customers leave and improve their retention strategies. While the recommendations are based on the data, they represent just one approach. Each company is unique, so solutions should be tailored to fit specific needs and market conditions. This analysis is a great starting point for developing effective strategies to reduce churn and boost customer retention, setting the stage for future success.
